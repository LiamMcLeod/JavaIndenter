# Java Formatter

This was a simple java application for formatting Java code. It was a mini-project made for my Introduction to Object Oriented Programming module at university.

## Usage
### Build
    javac Main.java JavaLine.java

### Run
    java Main < input.java > output.java

Or run the application, pasting in formatted or unformatted java.

The application should output your code formatted

## Development
Suggestions and improvements are welcome! But please take into account this is only a my first an incredibly simple application made for a University mini-Project.
